# Intro to Yolo
![yolo-img](images/yolo.png)</br>
In this repository, I aim at providing theoretical and practical notes for fully understanding `Yolo` models. Then, I 
show how to label a dataset which is downloaded from [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com) 
using [makesense.ai](https://www.makesense.ai/) to make it ready for training by `yolo` models. 
In addition, I have prepared a series of YouTube videos to make the process of learning and training a custom dataset as 
smooth and easy as possible. You can find the YouTube videos in the following playlist:</br>

Note: It may ask you to log in with your kaggle account, the simplest way is to log in with one the third-parties likes Google Account.

### Labeling dataset
For labeling this dataset, I use [makesense.ai](https://www.makesense.ai/). It's a handy and easy-to-begin system for 
labeling different image-based datasets. To better understand how to use makesense I
